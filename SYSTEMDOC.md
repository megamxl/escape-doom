## System Description

Escape Doom is a prototype for a web-based escape room designed to test the feasibility and technological requirements for creating such experiences. It includes a Java backend and a React frontend, featuring multiple components like the Game Session, Lector Portal, and Executor Service.

![Visual Abstract](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ9L0oeb1g.png)

The initial scope includes a single pre-configured escape room, with plans to evolve into a customizable tool. Students participate without the need for an account, while logged-in lecturers manage and control the escape room sessions.

This document aims to define the current state and establish new goals to transition the application from a distributed monolithic prototype into a clean microservice architecture.

## Projected Overhaul

### 1st Semester

#### Initial Refactoring:
  - Decouple existing components to increase modularity.
  - Eliminate in-memory state.
  - ..

#### Requirements Analysis:
  - Conduct a detailed analysis of the requirements necessary for transitioning from a monolithic to a microservice architecture.
  - Identify possible approaches, patterns, and best practices tailored to our needs.
  - Explore, evaluate and select new technologies.
  - ..

### 2nd Semester

#### Microservice Development and Testing:
  - Develop the individual microservices based on the identified requirements and patterns.
  - Test the new modular structure to ensure that each microservice operates independently and integrates effectively within the overall system.
  - ..

#### Handover Preparation:
  - Finalize the fully refactored and modularized microservice architecture.
  - Finalize documentation to ensure that the product is maintainable.
  - ..

| NT-04  | The system should be evaluated to streamline the escape room creation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |                        |
| NT-05  | The system should be evaluated for safe user code compilation and execution approaches. Non-binding ideas include using WASM, open-source serverless function frameworks, Docker, or Podman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |           |                        |
| NT-06  | The system could be evaluated for tracking key game events in the frontend, such as time on stages, necessary hint requests, and incorrect attempts, and sending them to the server via WebSockets. This evaluation includes assessing existing technologies, Redis for temporary storage, Kafka for batching and aggregation, and ultimately storing aggregated data in a database, enabling data access for analytics via custom dashboards or tools like Grafana, ELK stack. |           |                        |
